# Ad-Hoc SQL Projects üìä

## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This repository contains a collection of ad-hoc SQL queries designed to analyze and extract valuable insights from a retail events database. The queries address various business needs, such as identifying high-value discounted products, evaluating store presence in cities, assessing the financial impact of promotional campaigns, and analyzing incremental sales during specific campaigns.

## Project Structure üìÅ

- **ad-hoc-requests.docx**: A Word file containing the SQL questions.
- **Ad-Hoc Projects.sql**: A SQL file with the answers to the SQL questions.
- **meta.txt**: A text file with metadata information.
- **retail_events_db**: A folder containing the database files.

## SQL Queries and Descriptions üìù

### 1. High-Value Discounted Products 
**Objective**: Identify products with a base price greater than 500 that are featured in a 'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free) promotion. This helps evaluate pricing and promotion strategies.

### 2. Store Presence by City
**Objective**: Generate a report of the number of stores in each city, sorted in descending order of store counts. This helps optimize retail operations.

### 3. Campaign Revenue Report
**Objective**: Display each campaign's total revenue generated before and after the campaign. This helps evaluate the financial impact of promotional campaigns. (Values are displayed in millions).

### 4. Incremental Sold Quantity (ISU%) During Diwali Campaign
**Objective**: Calculate the Incremental Sold Quantity (ISU%) for each category during the Diwali campaign and provide rankings based on their ISU%. This helps assess the category-wise success and impact of the Diwali campaign on incremental sales.

### 5. Top 5 Products by Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%)
**Objective**: Identify the top 5 products ranked by Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%) across all campaigns. This helps identify the most successful products in terms of incremental revenue.
